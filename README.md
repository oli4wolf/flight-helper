# flight-helper
A paragliding helper giving me an offline map with the flight obstacles based on the M5Core2 (M5Unified).
It is a learning project in the matter of language, tooling and platform (ESP32).

Initial Idea came from: https://github.com/akchan/cycle_navi which seemed easy enought to adapt.
